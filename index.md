# Data science Slack workspace at the University of Arizona

## How to sign up:
Please read and agree to our [Code of Conduct](https://goo.gl/forms/zli3XS9jb9c3MAdq2) and fill out the associated form. Once you’ve filled out the form, you’ll be provided with an invite link to the Slack workspace.

## How to use Slack:
We’ve created a brief [User Guide to Slack](user-guide). There are great online resources as well.

## What is Slack?
Well, a better description can be found here (https://slack.com/features), but generally speaking, it’s a group-communication platform with helpful collaboration and code-insertion tools. The invitation is open to any member of the UA community: undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, faculty and staff.

The workspace is dedicated to connect all of UA data science community, and be a searchable, permanent space for questions about R, Python, data analysis, programming and the like. There seem to be a plethora of undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and faculty and staff on campus that all have questions about data, from writing for loops and making bar plots to different machine learning techniques, and the UA data science slack workspace can hopefully serve everyone’s needs.

Workshops and working groups at UA are wonderful and growing resources, but often the topic you need for your analysis on the paper you’re working on isn’t for a few weeks, or already happened. The Slack Workspace will fill in some of those gaps: you can ask the UA community your questions with (hopefully) speedy responses.

All of that being said, the group is in its infancy - please feel free to join, explore, post, chime in, ask questions and let us know what you think could be structured better, and what is working well.

What is Slack, you ask? Well, a better description can be found here 
(https://slack.com/features), but generally speaking, it’s a group-communication 
platform with helpful collaboration and code-insertion tools. The invitation is 
open to any member of the UA community: undergraduates, graduate students, 
postdocs, faculty and staff. 

The workspace is dedicated to connect all of UA data science community, and be a 
searchable, permanent space for questions about R, Python, data analysis, 
programming and the like. There seem to be a plethora of undergraduates, 
graduate students, postdocs and faculty and staff on campus that all have 
questions about data, from writing for loops and making bar plots to different 
machine learning techniques, and the UA data science slack workspace can 
hopefully serve everyone’s needs. 

Workshops and working groups at UA are wonderful and growing resources, but 
often the topic you need for your analysis on the paper you’re working on isn’t 
for a few weeks, or already happened. The Slack Workspace will fill in some of 
those gaps: you can ask the UA community your questions with (hopefully) speedy 
responses. 

All of that being said, the group is in its infancy - please feel free to join, 
explore, post, chime in, ask questions and let us know what you think could be 
structured better, and what is working well. 

How to sign up: 

You’ll need to read and agree to our 
[Code of Conduct](https://goo.gl/forms/zli3XS9jb9c3MAdq2). Once you’ve read and

We’ve created a brief (User Guide to Slack)[user-guide.md]. There are 
great online resources as well. Please feel free to contact us via email (or any 
of the administrators on the Workspace) if you have any questions.

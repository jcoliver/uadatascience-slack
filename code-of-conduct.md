# UA Data Science Slack Code of Conduct

The primary purpose of this Slack workspace is to provide a welcoming and supportive forum for all participants, regardless of background or identity.

We will not tolerate harassment. Harassment is any form of behavior intended to discriminate, insult, intimidate or cause discomfort. We are all here to learn and to get our work done, not make trouble for our peers.

In short, don’t be a jerk.

Prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to:

+ Insulting or threatening language
+ Display of sexual or violent images
+ Incitement of violence to one’s self or others
+ Sustained disruption
+ Unwanted messaging persisting after being asked to stop

This is not an exhaustive list. Please use your best judgment - if you think you might be acting like a jerk, you probably are.

Enforcement of this Code of Conduct will be respectful and not itself include any harassing behaviors. Thank you for helping to make this a positive and inclusive community.
